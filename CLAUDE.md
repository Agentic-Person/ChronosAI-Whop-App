# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**Video Wizard** - An AI-powered video learning assistant for Whop creators in education and coaching. The app transforms passive video courses into interactive, personalized learning experiences with AI chat, automated quizzing, and personalized learning schedules.

**Core Value:** Save creators 10+ hours/week in student support while increasing course completion rates from 15% to 60%+

**Target Market:** Educational creators on Whop (trading education 40%, e-commerce coaching 20%, real estate 15%, fitness 10%, AI training 15%)

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend/Backend:** Next.js 14 (App Router), React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui
- **Database:** Supabase PostgreSQL with pgvector for vector embeddings (alternative: Neon)
- **AI/ML:** Claude 3.5 Sonnet (chat, quiz generation), OpenAI (Whisper for transcription, embeddings for RAG)
- **Video Storage:** S3/Cloudflare R2
- **Authentication:** Whop OAuth + Supabase Auth
- **State Management:** Zustand
- **Automation:** n8n for webhooks and background workflows
- **Deployment:** Vercel (with Edge Functions)
- **Monitoring:** Sentry (errors), PostHog (analytics)

## Core Features (MVP)

1. **AI Chat with Video Search (RAG)** - Semantic search across video transcripts with timestamp citations
2. **Automated Video Processing** - Bulk upload → transcription → chunking → vector embeddings
3. **AI Quiz Generation** - Dynamic assessments from video content with scoring
4. **Learning Calendar** - AI-generated personalized study schedules
5. **Progress Tracking** - Student completion analytics and recommendations
6. **Creator Dashboard** - Video management, student analytics, performance metrics
7. **Whop Integration** - Native OAuth, membership sync, webhook handlers

## Database Schema (Supabase PostgreSQL)

### Key Tables

- **creators** - Whop company integration with subscription tiers
- **students** - Whop user/membership integration with learning preferences
- **videos** - Video metadata, URLs, transcripts, processing status
- **video_chunks** - Text chunks with vector embeddings (1536 dimensions for OpenAI ada-002)
- **chat_sessions** / **chat_messages** - Conversation history with video references
- **quizzes** / **quiz_attempts** - AI-generated assessments and student scores
- **calendar_events** - Scheduled learning tasks (video, quiz, milestone)

### Vector Search Setup

```sql
-- Enable pgvector extension
CREATE EXTENSION vector;

-- Vector similarity search index
CREATE INDEX ON video_chunks USING ivfflat (embedding vector_cosine_ops);
```

## Key Implementation Patterns

### Whop Authentication Middleware

All API routes must validate Whop OAuth tokens and membership status:

```typescript
// middleware/auth.ts
export async function withWhopAuth(handler: NextApiHandler) {
  const token = req.headers.authorization?.replace('Bearer ', '');
  const user = await whopAuth.verifyUser(token);
  const membership = await whopAuth.validateMembership(user.membershipId);

  if (!user || !membership) {
    return res.status(401).json({ error: 'Unauthorized' });
  }

  req.user = user;
  return handler(req, res);
}
```

### Video Processing Pipeline

1. Upload video to storage (S3/R2)
2. Extract audio and transcribe (Whisper API or Deepgram)
3. Chunk transcript into 500-1000 word segments with overlap
4. Generate embeddings via OpenAI API
5. Store in `video_chunks` table with pgvector
6. Update video status to "processed"

### RAG Chat Flow

1. User query → generate embedding
2. Vector similarity search in `video_chunks`
3. Retrieve top 3-5 relevant chunks with video metadata
4. Build context for Claude API
5. Generate response citing video timestamps
6. Return response with clickable video references

### Quiz Generation

1. Select videos for quiz scope
2. Extract key concepts via Claude API
3. Generate questions (multiple choice, true/false, short answer)
4. Validate question quality and relevance
5. Store in `quizzes` table with correct answers
6. Each generation produces unique questions

## API Endpoints (RESTful)

### Student APIs
- `POST /api/student/chat` - Send message, get AI response with video references
- `GET /api/student/calendar` - Retrieve personalized learning schedule
- `POST /api/student/quiz/attempt` - Submit quiz answers for grading
- `PATCH /api/student/progress` - Update video completion status

### Creator APIs
- `POST /api/creator/videos/upload` - Bulk video upload with processing
- `GET /api/creator/analytics` - Student metrics and engagement data
- `POST /api/creator/quiz/generate` - AI quiz creation from videos
- `GET /api/creator/students` - List students with progress data

### Webhook APIs
- `POST /api/webhooks/whop` - Handle membership created/expired/payment events

## Whop Integration Requirements

### Environment Variables
```bash
WHOP_API_KEY=           # From Whop developer dashboard
WHOP_CLIENT_ID=         # OAuth client ID
WHOP_WEBHOOK_SECRET=    # For webhook signature verification
```

### Webhook Events to Handle
- `membership.created` → Provision student access
- `membership.expired` → Revoke student access
- `payment.succeeded` → Log for analytics

### Security Checklist
- Verify Whop webhook signatures on all webhook endpoints
- Validate membership status before serving content
- Rate limiting: 100 requests/minute per user
- SQL injection prevention (use parameterized queries)
- Store all secrets in environment variables only

## Performance Requirements

- Chat response time: < 5 seconds (95th percentile)
- Video processing: < 5 minutes per hour of video
- Dashboard load time: < 3 seconds
- Search results: < 2 seconds
- Support 1000+ concurrent users

## Testing Strategy

### Test Coverage Areas
- Whop OAuth flow and token validation
- Webhook signature verification and event processing
- Video processing pipeline (upload → transcript → embeddings)
- RAG search accuracy and response quality
- Quiz generation relevance and scoring logic
- Calendar scheduling algorithm
- Student progress tracking

### Integration Tests
- End-to-end video processing pipeline
- Chat with real vector search queries
- Whop API authentication flow
- Database query performance (especially vector search)

## Development Workflow (TDD)

This project follows Test-Driven Development principles:

1. **Write tests first** for new features based on requirements
2. **Implement** to pass tests
3. **Refactor** while maintaining test coverage
4. **Validate** against success metrics

## Monitoring & Error Handling

- Use Sentry for error tracking on all API routes
- Log all critical operations (video processing, AI calls, payments)
- Track performance metrics (response times, processing duration)
- Alert on failures (transcription errors, AI API errors, webhook failures)
- Graceful degradation if AI API down (show cached responses)

## Cost Optimization

- Cache AI embeddings to avoid reprocessing
- Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Use efficient prompting for Claude API calls
- Batch embedding generation when possible
- Monitor AI API usage and set alerts

## Launch Strategy

### Phase 1: Private Beta (Week 5-6)
- 10 hand-picked creators with direct support
- Goal: Validate features, identify critical bugs

### Phase 2: Public Launch (Week 7)
- Whop App Store listing
- Goal: 50 trial signups, 40% conversion

### Phase 3: Growth (Month 2-6)
- Feature iteration based on feedback
- Goal: 100 paying creators, $10K MRR

## Success Metrics (KPIs)

- **Activation:** 80% of creators upload 5+ videos
- **Engagement:** 10+ chat messages per student/week
- **Retention:** 60% of students complete 50%+ of course
- **Quality:** 85%+ thumbs up on AI responses
- **Business:** $10K MRR by Month 6, <5% churn

## Common Gotchas

- Whop webhook signatures must be verified on every request
- Vector embeddings are 1536 dimensions for OpenAI ada-002
- Chunk size affects search quality (500-1000 words optimal)
- Always use parameterized queries for SQL (pgvector included)
- Rate limit AI API calls to prevent cost overruns
- Test membership validation edge cases (expired, invalid, etc.)

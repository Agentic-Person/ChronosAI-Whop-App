# Module 6: Creator Dashboard - Overview

## Executive Summary

The Creator Dashboard is the command center where educators manage their entire learning platform: upload content, view analytics, monitor student progress, generate quizzes, and export data. **This is what creators see when they log in - it must be powerful yet intuitive.**

**Status**: Full Implementation Required
**Priority**: P0 (CRITICAL - Core creator experience)
**Dependencies**: Video Processing (Module 2), Whop Integration (Module 7), Backend Infrastructure (Module 8)

## Problem Statement

### Why Creators Leave Platforms

**Pain Points from Research**:
- ‚ùå "I spend 10+ hours/week answering the same questions"
- ‚ùå "I have no idea if students are actually learning"
- ‚ùå "Video uploads are painful and slow"
- ‚ùå "I can't see where students get stuck"
- ‚ùå "Exporting data requires emailing support"
- ‚ùå "The analytics are useless (vanity metrics)"

**What Creators Actually Need**:
- ‚úÖ See student progress at a glance
- ‚úÖ Identify struggling students proactively
- ‚úÖ Know which videos need improvement
- ‚úÖ Bulk upload videos effortlessly
- ‚úÖ Generate quizzes automatically
- ‚úÖ Export data on demand (CSV, PDF)
- ‚úÖ Answer common questions once (AI handles the rest)

### Our Value Proposition

**Time Saved**: 10+ hours/week in support

## Technical Implementation

### Database Queries for Dashboard

**Efficient Aggregation Queries**:

```sql
-- Daily active users (cached)
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW daily_active_users AS
SELECT
  DATE(last_active) as date,
  creator_id,
  COUNT(DISTINCT id) as active_count
FROM students
WHERE last_active >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30 days'
GROUP BY DATE(last_active), creator_id;

-- Refresh hourly
CREATE INDEX idx_dau_creator_date ON daily_active_users(creator_id, date);

-- Video analytics (aggregated)
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW video_analytics AS
SELECT
  v.id as video_id,
  v.creator_id,
  COUNT(DISTINCT vp.student_id) as unique_viewers,
  AVG(vp.watch_percentage) as avg_watch_percentage,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE vp.completed = true) as completions,
  AVG(vp.watch_duration) as avg_watch_duration
FROM videos v
LEFT JOIN video_progress vp ON v.id = vp.video_id
GROUP BY v.id, v.creator_id;

-- Most asked questions
SELECT
  cm.content,
  COUNT(*) as ask_count,
  COUNT(DISTINCT cs.student_id) as unique_askers,
  AVG(
    CASE WHEN cm.helpful_rating IS NOT NULL
      THEN cm.helpful_rating
      ELSE NULL
    END
  ) as avg_satisfaction
FROM chat_messages cm
JOIN chat_sessions cs ON cm.session_id = cs.id
WHERE cm.role = 'user'
  AND cs.creator_id = $1
  AND cm.created_at >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30 days'
GROUP BY cm.content
ORDER BY ask_count DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

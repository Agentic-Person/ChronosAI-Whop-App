# Module 1: RAG Chat Engine - Overview

## Executive Summary

The RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) Chat Engine is the core AI-powered feature that enables students to ask questions about course content and receive instant, accurate answers with exact video timestamp citations.

**Status**: Full Implementation Required
**Priority**: P0 (Critical Path)
**Dependencies**: Video Processing Pipeline (Module 2), Backend Infrastructure (Module 8)

## Problem Statement

### Student Pain Points
- Students waste hours searching through video content for specific information
- Can't find answers to specific questions without rewatching entire videos
- No immediate help when stuck on a concept
- Traditional text search doesn't understand semantic meaning

### What We're Solving
- **Instant Answers**: Get AI responses in <5 seconds
- **Precise References**: Jump directly to relevant video timestamps
- **Contextual Understanding**: AI understands project-specific questions
- **Conversation History**: Maintain context across multiple questions

## Who Uses This Feature

### Primary Users: Students
- Ask questions while learning
- Get unstuck on projects
- Find specific concepts quickly
- Review material efficiently

### Secondary Users: Creators
- Monitor most-asked questions
- Identify content gaps
- Reduce support time by 10+ hours/week

## Key Success Metrics

| Metric | Target | Measurement |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Response Time | <5 seconds (95th percentile) | API latency monitoring |
| Answer Accuracy | 85%+ thumbs up rate | User feedback tracking |
| Usage | 10+ messages per student/week | Analytics events |
| Support Reduction | 10+ hours saved/creator/week | Creator surveys |

## System Capabilities

### Must Have (MVP)
- [x] Semantic search across all video transcripts
- [x] AI response generation with Claude 3.5 Sonnet
- [x] Video timestamp citations (clickable links)
- [x] Conversation history persistence
- [x] Feedback mechanism (thumbs up/down)
- [x] Multi-tenancy (creator isolation)

### Should Have (Phase 2)
- [ ] Project-specific context ("How do I implement auth in MY e-commerce project?")
- [ ] Code snippet responses with syntax highlighting
- [ ] Voice input support
- [ ] Suggested follow-up questions

### Nice to Have (Future)
- [ ] Multi-language support
- [ ] Image/diagram generation for explanations
- [ ] Integration with external documentation
- [ ] Student-to-student Q&A matching

## Dependencies

### Upstream Dependencies (We Need These First)
1. **Video Processing Pipeline** - Must have processed videos with transcripts
2. **Vector Embeddings** - video_chunks table populated with embeddings
3. **Backend Infrastructure** - Supabase client, rate limiting

### Downstream Dependencies (These Need Us)
1. **Progress Tracking** - Chat interactions count toward engagement
2. **Analytics** - Track most-asked questions
3. **Discord Bot** - `/ask` command uses this RAG engine

## Technology Stack

| Component | Technology | Why |
|-----------|------------|-----|
| AI Model | Claude 3.5 Sonnet | Best reasoning, follows instructions precisely |
| Embeddings | OpenAI ada-002 | Industry standard, cost-effective |
| Vector DB | Supabase pgvector | Already using Supabase, no extra service |
| Orchestration | Langchain | Simplifies RAG pipeline |
| Frontend | React + Framer Motion | Smooth chat experience |

## Cost Considerations

### AI API Costs (Monthly Estimate for 100 Students)
- **Claude API**: ~$50-100/month (assumes 1000 queries/student/month)
- **OpenAI Embeddings**: ~$10/month (query embedding only)
- **Total**: ~$60-110/month per 100 students

### Optimization Strategies
1. Cache common questions and responses (30-day TTL)
2. Implement rate limiting (20 queries/minute per student)
3. Use shorter context windows when possible
4. Batch embedding requests

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| High AI costs | Medium | High | Implement caching, rate limits |
| Inaccurate responses | Low | High | Add feedback loop, improve prompts |
| Slow response times | Medium | Medium | Optimize vector search, use caching |
| Context window limits | Low | Medium | Implement smart chunking |

4. Check `TESTING.md` - Set up test environment
5. See `INTEGRATION.md` - Connect with other modules

## Questions to Resolve

- [ ] Should we support voice input in v1?
- [ ] How to handle questions outside course content?
- [ ] Should we show "related questions" suggestions?
- [ ] What's the max conversation history length?

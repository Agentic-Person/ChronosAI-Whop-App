### Monthly Operating Costs by Tier

| Tier | Price | Videos | Cost | Margin | Status |
|------|-------|--------|------|--------|---------|
| **Basic** | $29/mo | 10 videos | $6.86 | $22.14 (76%) | ✅ Very Profitable |

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Database Setup ✅
```bash
# Run migration
supabase db push
```

Creates:
- `creators.trial_started_at` - Trial start timestamp
- `creators.trial_expires_at` - Trial expiration (7 days later)
- `creators.trial_status` - 'active', 'expired', 'converted'
- `creators.has_demo_content` - Demo provision flag
- `videos.is_demo_content` - Demo video marker
- `courses.is_demo` - Demo course marker

### Phase 2: Process Demo Videos (Manual, 30 min)
```bash
# Set API key
export DEMO_SETUP_API_KEY="your_supabase_service_role_key"

# Run script (processes all 6 videos)
npx tsx scripts/setup-demo-content.ts
```

This will:
- Download and transcribe 6 YouTube videos
- Generate embeddings for RAG
- Create 2 demo courses
- Store in system account (creator_id: 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001)

### Phase 3: Deploy Code ✅
All TypeScript files are created and ready to deploy.

### Phase 4: Configure Whop (Required Before Launch)

#### 4.1 Create Products in Whop Dashboard
Create 3 monthly subscription products:
1. **Basic** - $29/month
2. **Pro** - $99/month (mark as "Most Popular")
3. **Enterprise** - $299/month

Note the product IDs (e.g., `prod_basic_monthly`)

#### 4.2 Set Environment Variables
```bash
# Add to .env.local and Vercel
WHOP_BASIC_PRODUCT_ID=prod_xxxxx
WHOP_PRO_PRODUCT_ID=prod_xxxxx
WHOP_ENTERPRISE_PRODUCT_ID=prod_xxxxx
WHOP_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_xxxxx
```

#### 4.3 Configure Webhooks in Whop
Add webhook URL: `https://chronos-ai.app/api/whop/webhooks`

Subscribe to events:
- `payment.succeeded`
- `membership.created`
- `membership.deleted`
- `membership.went_valid`
- `membership.went_invalid`

#### 4.4 Update Whop App Listing
- Enable "Free Trial" badge
- Mention "7-day free trial with demo content"
- Add install URL: `https://chronos-ai.app/api/whop/install`

## Testing Checklist

### Manual Testing (Critical)
- [ ] Run database migration
- [ ] Process 6 demo videos with script
- [ ] Test install flow (mock or real Whop install)
- [ ] Verify demo content appears in dashboard
- [ ] Test AI chat on demo videos
- [ ] Verify upload button is locked
- [ ] Test upgrade page (/upgrade)
- [ ] Test Whop checkout flow
- [ ] Test webhook: payment.succeeded
- [ ] Verify demo content deleted after upgrade
- [ ] Verify can upload videos post-upgrade

### Edge Cases
- [ ] What if demo content already exists? (Skip provisioning)
- [ ] What if trial already expired? (Force upgrade immediately)
- [ ] What if Whop webhook fails? (Retry mechanism)
- [ ] What if demo videos missing? (Graceful fallback)
- [ ] What if creator uninstalls during trial? (Clean up)

## Known Limitations & Future Improvements

### Current Limitations
- Demo content must be manually provisioned (one-time script)
- No automatic trial expiration cron job (manual call to `markExpiredTrials()`)
- Hard-coded system creator ID (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001)
- Whop product IDs must be manually configured

### Future Improvements
- Auto-provision demo content on first install
- Scheduled cron job for trial expiration
- Admin panel to manage demo content
- A/B test different trial lengths (7 vs 14 days)
- Analytics dashboard for trial metrics
- Email reminders for trial expiration
- Extend trial option for engaged users

---

## Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Demo content not appearing?**
- Check system account exists (`creator_id: 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001`)
- Verify demo videos processed successfully
- Check `has_demo_content` flag in `creators` table

**Trial not starting on install?**
- Check `/api/whop/install` logs
- Verify `trial_started_at` and `trial_expires_at` set
- Check `trial_status = 'active'`

**Upgrade not working?**
- Verify Whop product IDs correct
- Check webhook secret configured
- Confirm webhook URL accessible
- Review `/api/whop/webhooks` logs

**Demo content not deleted after upgrade?**
- Check `removeDemoContent()` was called
- Verify `is_demo_content = true` on videos
- Manually delete: `DELETE FROM videos WHERE creator_id = 'xxx' AND is_demo_content = true`

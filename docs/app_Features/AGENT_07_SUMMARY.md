## Blockers / Decisions Needed

### Completed Items
✅ Database schema design
✅ AI prompt engineering for quizzes
✅ AI prompt engineering for code review
✅ Rate limit values
✅ XP reward amounts
✅ Feature tier assignments

### Future Considerations
⚠️ **React Components** - Not implemented in this phase
   - QuizTaker, QuizBuilder, ProjectCard components
   - CodeEditor integration (Monaco or CodeMirror)
   - ReviewDashboard UI
   - Recommend creating these as part of frontend development sprint

⚠️ **Code Execution** - Short answer and code challenges use keyword matching
   - For production, consider sandbox execution (e.g., Judge0 API)
   - Or implement AST parsing for code validation

⚠️ **Plagiarism Detection** - Not implemented
   - Could use cosine similarity on code embeddings
   - Or integrate third-party service (MOSS, Codequiry)

⚠️ **Video Walkthrough Reviews** - Future enhancement
   - Allow students to record code walkthroughs
   - AI analysis of explanation quality

---

## Success Criteria

✅ AI generates relevant, valid quiz questions
✅ Code review provides actionable, constructive feedback
✅ Project templates are comprehensive and realistic
✅ Peer review system prevents spam and ensures quality
✅ Feature gating enforces PRO tier correctly

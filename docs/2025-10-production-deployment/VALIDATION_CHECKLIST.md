# Security Fix Validation Checklist

Use this checklist to validate that all authentication bypasses have been properly removed and the application is ready for production deployment.

---

## Automated Verification

### 1. Run Security Verification Script

```bash
./scripts/verify-auth-security.sh
```

**Expected Output:**
```
âœ… ALL SECURITY CHECKS PASSED
Application is PRODUCTION READY
```

If this passes, you can be confident that:
- No TODO markers for production removal
- No DEV MODE bypasses
- No placeholder UUIDs
- No unsafe header manipulations
- All required imports are present

---

## Manual Code Review

### 2. Review Modified Files

Check each modified file to understand the changes:

```bash
# View all changes
git diff app/api/

# View specific file changes
git diff app/api/video/upload-url/route.ts
git diff app/api/video/create/route.ts
git diff app/api/upload/session/create/route.ts
git diff app/api/video/youtube-import/route.ts
git diff app/api/creator/stats/route.ts
git diff app/api/courses/route.ts
git diff app/api/video/list/route.ts
```

**What to verify:**
- [ ] All `TODO: REMOVE BEFORE PRODUCTION` comments removed
- [ ] No hardcoded `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001` UUIDs
- [ ] No `req.headers.get('x-creator-id')` without validation
- [ ] Proper Supabase auth checks added
- [ ] Error responses return 401/403 as appropriate

---

## Integration Testing

### 3. Test Unauthenticated Requests

These should all return `401 Unauthorized`:

```bash
# Test video upload URL generation
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/video/upload-url \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"filename":"test.mp4","contentType":"video/mp4","fileSize":1000000}'
# Expected: 401 Unauthorized

# Test video list
curl http://localhost:3000/api/video/list
# Expected: 401 Unauthorized

# Test creator stats
curl http://localhost:3000/api/creator/stats
# Expected: 401 Unauthorized

# Test course listing
curl http://localhost:3000/api/courses
# Expected: 401 Unauthorized
```

**Validation:**
- [ ] All unauthenticated requests return 401
- [ ] Error messages include "Authentication required"
- [ ] No data is leaked in error responses

### 4. Test with Invalid Authentication

These should also return `401 Unauthorized`:

```bash
# Test with fake token
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/video/upload-url \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer fake-token-12345" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"filename":"test.mp4","contentType":"video/mp4","fileSize":1000000}'
# Expected: 401 Unauthorized

# Test with expired token (use an old token you have)
curl http://localhost:3000/api/video/list \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer expired-token"
# Expected: 401 Unauthorized
```

**Validation:**
- [ ] Invalid tokens are rejected
- [ ] Expired tokens are rejected
- [ ] No access granted to resources

### 5. Test with Valid Authentication

These should work correctly with a valid Supabase auth token:

```bash
# Get a valid token first by logging in via the UI
# Then test each endpoint

# Test video upload URL generation
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/video/upload-url \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_VALID_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"filename":"test.mp4","contentType":"video/mp4","fileSize":1000000}'
# Expected: 200 OK with upload URL

# Test video list
curl http://localhost:3000/api/video/list \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_VALID_TOKEN"
# Expected: 200 OK with video list

# Test creator stats
curl http://localhost:3000/api/creator/stats \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_VALID_TOKEN"
# Expected: 200 OK with stats
```

**Validation:**
- [ ] Valid authentication works
- [ ] User can access their own data
- [ ] No errors in legitimate requests

### 6. Test Cross-Creator Access (Multi-Tenancy)

If you have multiple creator accounts, verify data isolation:

```bash
# Login as Creator A, try to access Creator B's resources
# This should either return 403 or empty results (depending on endpoint)

# Example: Try to list videos of another creator
# Should only show authenticated creator's videos
curl http://localhost:3000/api/video/list \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer CREATOR_A_TOKEN"
# Expected: Only Creator A's videos, not Creator B's
```

**Validation:**
- [ ] Creators can only see their own data
- [ ] No cross-creator data leakage
- [ ] Attempts to access other creators' data fail gracefully

---

## Functional Testing

### 7. Test Mobile Upload Flow

Verify the mobile upload session flow still works:

```bash
# Step 1: Create upload session (authenticated)
SESSION=$(curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/upload/session/create \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_VALID_TOKEN" \
  -s | jq -r '.sessionToken')

echo "Session token: $SESSION"

# Step 2: Use session token to upload (unauthenticated but with sessionToken)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/video/upload-url \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"filename\":\"test.mp4\",\"contentType\":\"video/mp4\",\"fileSize\":1000000,\"sessionToken\":\"$SESSION\"}"
# Expected: 200 OK with upload URL

# Step 3: Confirm upload (with sessionToken)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/video/create \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"videoId\":\"<video-id>\",\"sessionToken\":\"$SESSION\"}"
# Expected: 200 OK
```

**Validation:**
- [ ] Session creation requires auth
- [ ] Session tokens work for mobile uploads
- [ ] Session tokens expire after 15 minutes
- [ ] Invalid session tokens are rejected

### 8. Test YouTube Import

```bash
# Import a YouTube video (requires auth)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/video/youtube-import \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_VALID_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"youtubeUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ"}'
# Expected: 200 OK with video metadata
```

**Validation:**
- [ ] YouTube import requires authentication
- [ ] Imported videos belong to authenticated creator
- [ ] Unauthenticated imports are rejected

### 9. Test Course Management

```bash
# List courses
curl http://localhost:3000/api/courses \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_VALID_TOKEN"
# Expected: 200 OK with creator's courses

# Create course
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/courses \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_VALID_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"title":"Test Course","description":"Test Description"}'
# Expected: 200 OK with created course
```

**Validation:**
- [ ] Course listing requires auth
- [ ] Course creation requires auth
- [ ] Courses belong to authenticated creator

---

## Performance Testing

### 10. Measure Auth Overhead

```bash
# Before auth (if you have old version):
time curl http://localhost:3000/api/video/list -H "x-creator-id: ..."

# After auth:
time curl http://localhost:3000/api/video/list -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

**Validation:**
- [ ] Response time increase < 100ms
- [ ] 95th percentile < 500ms
- [ ] No significant performance degradation

---

## Security Audit

### 11. Check for Common Vulnerabilities

```bash
# Search for any remaining bypasses
grep -r "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001" app/api/
# Expected: No results

# Search for unsafe header usage
grep -r "req.headers.get('x-creator-id')" app/api/ | grep -v "SECURITY"
# Expected: No results

# Search for TODO markers
grep -r "TODO.*PRODUCTION" app/api/
# Expected: No results

# Search for DEV MODE
grep -r "DEV MODE" app/api/
# Expected: No results
```

**Validation:**
- [ ] No security bypasses remain
- [ ] No development-only code in API routes
- [ ] All endpoints properly secured

---

## Database Testing

### 12. Verify Row Level Security (RLS)

```sql
-- Test that RLS is working correctly
-- Login to Supabase SQL Editor and run:

-- Test 1: Try to access videos table without auth (should fail)
SELECT * FROM videos LIMIT 10;

-- Test 2: With proper auth context, should only see own videos
-- (This should be tested via the API routes we just secured)
```

**Validation:**
- [ ] Database RLS policies are enabled
- [ ] API routes respect RLS policies
- [ ] No direct database access without auth

---

## Staging Environment Testing

### 13. Deploy to Staging

```bash
# Deploy to staging environment
git checkout -b security-fix-auth-bypasses
git add app/api/
git commit -m "fix(security): remove all authentication bypasses from API routes

BREAKING CHANGE: All API routes now require proper Supabase authentication.
Development bypasses using x-creator-id headers and placeholder UUIDs have been removed.

Fixes:
- VULN-001: Authentication bypass in 7 API routes
- Removed placeholder UUID 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001
- Removed x-creator-id header bypasses
- Added proper Supabase auth checks

Files modified:
- app/api/video/upload-url/route.ts

## üìß Outreach Templates

### Template 1: Cold DM (Twitter/Instagram)

Hey [Name]! üëã

I've been following [Community Name] and I'm impressed by [specific thing - e.g., "your daily live streams" or "the depth of your course content"].

Quick question: How much time do you spend answering the same student questions every week?

I built an AI assistant specifically for course creators on Whop that:
‚úì Answers student questions instantly with exact video timestamps
‚úì Auto-generates quizzes from your content
‚úì Creates personalized learning schedules

[Creator X] is testing it now and said "[make up a quote like 'it's like having 5 support staff']"

Mind if I send you a 2-min demo video?

Best,
[Your Name]

P.S. I'm only working with 10 creators initially - spots are limited.

I'm actually a developer who builds tools for course creators, and I couldn't help but notice [specific pain point - e.g., "students in the Discord keep asking where to find info about X"].

I built something that might help: an AI that lets students chat with your course content and get instant answers with video timestamps.

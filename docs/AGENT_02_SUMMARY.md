# Agent 2 Summary: Whop MCP Integration & Video Processing Pipeline

## Mission Complete

Agent 2 has successfully built the **complete Whop MCP integration** and **video upload/processing infrastructure** for Chronos AI.

## What Was Built

### 1. Whop MCP Integration (mcp/)

**mcp/mcpClient.ts** - WhopMCPClient class for communicating with Whop's Model Context Protocol endpoint
- `sendAction()` - Send actions to Whop MCP
- `registerWebhook()` - Register webhook listeners for events
- `verifyWebhookSignature()` - HMAC signature verification for security
- `getCreatorDetails()` - Fetch creator info from Whop API
- `notifyProvisioningStatus()` - Update Whop on provisioning progress

**mcp/webhookHandler.ts** - Webhook processing logic for Whop events
- `handleWhopWebhook()` - Main webhook handler with signature verification
- `handleCreatorInstalled()` - Provisions new creator resources
- `handleCreatorUninstalled()` - Decommissions creator resources
- `handleWebhookHealthCheck()` - Health check endpoint

### 2. Creator Lifecycle Management (scripts/)

**scripts/bootstrapCreator.ts** - Complete creator provisioning pipeline
- `provisionCreator()` - Main provisioning orchestrator
  1. Creates creator record in Supabase
  2. Sets up storage buckets (videos, assets, thumbnails)
  3. Creates folder structure: {creator_slug}/videos/, etc.
  4. Applies RLS policies for data isolation
  5. Notifies Whop of success/failure

**scripts/decommissionCreator.ts** - Creator removal & data archival
- `decommissionCreator()` - Main decommissioning orchestrator
  - Soft Delete (default): Mark inactive, schedule 30-day retention
  - Hard Delete (optional): Permanently remove all data
- `purgeExpiredCreators()` - Scheduled job to clean up archived creators
- `restoreCreator()` - Restore soft-deleted creator within retention period

### 3. Database Migrations (supabase/migrations/)

**20251022000003_upload_sessions_and_rls.sql**
- New table: `upload_sessions` for QR code mobile uploads
- Comprehensive RLS policies for all tables
- Storage bucket policies documented
- Helper functions: `get_creator_id_from_auth()`, `is_creator()`, etc.

### 4. API Routes (app/api/)

**app/api/webhooks/whop/route.ts**
- POST /api/webhooks/whop - Receives Whop MCP events
- GET /api/webhooks/whop - Health check endpoint

### 5. Documentation

**ARCHITECTURE.md** (3,700+ words)
- Multi-tenant design overview
- Data flow diagrams
- Complete directory structure
- Database schema with all tables
- RLS policies explained
- Storage structure
- Environment variables
- Security considerations

**SETUP.md** (2,500+ words)
- Prerequisites checklist
- Quick start guide
- Detailed Whop setup
- Supabase setup
- Environment configuration
- Testing instructions
- Troubleshooting guide

### 6. Existing Infrastructure Verified

Agent 2 verified that video processing utilities already exist:
- `lib/video/transcription.ts` - OpenAI Whisper integration
- `lib/video/chunking.ts` - Intelligent semantic chunking
- `lib/video/embedding-generator.ts` - OpenAI embeddings (ada-002)
- `lib/video/index.ts` - Unified public API

```

## Key Features Implemented

- Multi-tenant creator provisioning via Whop MCP
- Automated storage folder creation per creator
- Row-Level Security policies for data isolation
- Soft delete with 30-day retention period
- HMAC webhook signature verification
- Complete video processing pipeline (verified existing)
- Comprehensive documentation

## Success Criteria

- [x] MCP Client - Full Whop MCP integration
- [x] Webhook Handler - Signature verification, event routing
- [x] Creator Provisioning - Automated setup on app install
- [x] Creator Decommissioning - Soft/hard delete
- [x] RLS Policies - Row-level security for all tables
- [x] Upload Sessions - Table for QR code uploads
- [x] Video Processing - Verified existing pipeline
- [x] API Routes - Webhook endpoint
- [x] Documentation - ARCHITECTURE.md + SETUP.md
- [x] Environment Config - Updated .env.example

## Next Steps

The foundation is complete. Future work includes:
1. Build upload UI components
2. Implement QR code mobile upload
3. Add processing status UI
4. Deploy to production
5. Register webhook with Whop

**Status**: Ready for Phase 2 (Upload UI implementation)

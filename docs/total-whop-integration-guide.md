## Overview

This guide merges your Product Requirements (PRD), technical implementation roadmap, your existing full-stack skillset (Node.js, React, Supabase, Vercel, n8n, Claude AI), and all best practices into a single, comprehensive playbook for successfully integrating an advanced AI-powered Learning Assistant app with **Whop (WAP)**.

**Audience:** Solo and small team developers with strong full-stack capabilities, familiar with AI workflows, building on Whop’s education, coaching, or community platform.

---

## Why Whop? (Summary)

- **Fast-growing digital marketplace for educational and coaching creators** (trading, e-commerce, real estate, fitness, AI, SaaS)
- Revenue/share model with built-in userbase and Stripe payment pipelines
- Supports embedded apps (custom iFrame, external web, SaaS connect)
- Robust developer SDKs for React/Node
- Webhook, membership, and payment APIs for deep integration
- Compatible with Vercel, Supabase, modern workflows

---

## Full App Integration Scope

### Features to Build (from PRD)
1. AI-powered chat that answers student questions from video content (RAG, vector search, timestamped links)
2. Automated video upload/transcription/embedding
3. AI quiz generation and adaptive testing
4. Personalized learning calendar and to-do automation
5. Student progress tracker
6. Creator analytics dashboard
7. Native Whop authentication and payment/membership sync via API + webhooks
8. Scalable backend with cloud (Supabase/Neon + Vercel) and n8n/workflow hooks

---

## Developer Skillset Leverage

- **Node.js & React:** Main frontend, backend, and iFrame wrappers
- **Supabase/Neon:** Video vector storage, auth, per-user tracking
- **n8n:** For cancelation, onboarding, and other automations (via Whop webhooks)
- **Claude/AI:** Content chunking, semantic search, quiz/test creation, curriculum planner
- **Vercel:** Frontend and serverless API deployment (Whop-native support)
- **API/Webhooks:** Deep sync to Whop for authentication/membership

---

## Complete Integration Blueprint

### 1. Enroll As a Whop Developer
- Register on https://whop.com/dashboard/dev
- Create an app (Education/Learning focus)
- Set up API credentials: `WHOP_API_KEY`, `WHOP_CLIENT_ID`, `WHOP_WEBHOOK_SECRET`
- Whitelist all planned Vercel endpoints for Whop to call (auth, webhooks)
  
### 2. Project Setup
- Use existing Vercel project as basis (Next.js + API routes + Tailwind + shadcn/ui)
- Add Whop SDK, React integration, support for iFrame context
- Add .env vars for all Whop, Supabase, and AI keys
- Enable CORS for trusted Whop domains

### 3. Database Architecture
- Use/extend Supabase Postgres with tables:
  - Creators (Whop IDs, app settings)
  - Students (Whop user, membership, last active)
  - Videos (URL, metadata, transcript, embeddings, timestamps)
  - Chunks (vector indices)
  - Quizzes/Attempts
  - Calendar Events/Progress
- pgvector for semantic search (via Supabase or use Pinecone if scaling)

### 4. Auth/Membership Integration
- Use @whop/react + OAuth for frontend login
- Backend API checks Whop tokens and membership before serving content
- Register webhook handler (`/api/webhooks/whop`) for payment/membership events
- Map Whop user and membership IDs to local DB users for all actions

### 5. Video & Content Pipeline
- Bulk upload videos, trigger async Whisper/Deepgram transcription
- Process transcripts into 500+ word chunks, embed via OpenAI/Claude API
- Store vectors in pgvector for semantic RAG retrieval
- Track each upload’s status, errors, and completion

### 6. AI Chat, Calendar & Quizzes
- Chat frontend runs as Whop iFrame, fetches user ID from context
- AI RAG engine queries semantic vector DB, returns timestamped sources
- Claude or GPT API generates answers using in-context video content only
- Quiz module uses same RAG for question set creation per video/topic
- Calendar feature: Given user’s target completion, auto-schedules videos/quizzes, updates Supabase with events

### 7. Creator Dashboard Tools
- Video upload/status tracking in dashboard
- Analytics: Active students, completion rates, question stats
- Export data (CSV), manage students/videos/quizzes

### 8. Automated Workflows (n8n)
- Trigger n8n flows on board new student, when membership valid/invalid, after payment events
- Integrate with Discord/Telegram if needed for notifications

### 9. Frontend Polishing & UX
- Use Tailwind + shadcn/ui for Whop-native look
- Ensure mobile responsiveness for all student/creator views
- Add easy navigation (Chat/Calendar/Videos/Quizzes, etc.)
- Error handling, loading states, progress indicators

### 10. Deployment & Testing
- Deploy to Vercel (production endpoints ready for Whop calls)
- Map all API and webhook URLs in Whop app settings
- Test Whop OAuth/SSO, membership sync, webhook delivery (using test memberships)
- Run user-flow tests as both creator and student

---

## Final Pre-Launch Checklist

- [ ] All Whop webhooks validate signature
- [ ] All API routes require valid Whop session/membership
- [ ] Video/Quiz/Calendar/Chat tested in production sandbox
- [ ] Creator onboarding flow clear and works with real Whop account
- [ ] Security: environment secrets, rate limiting, error masking
- [ ] Analytics logging for all key flows
- [ ] Ready demo (Loom), outreach templates, feedback form

---

## Best Practices & Tips

- Emphasize single sign-on and seamless Whop experience: users never need an extra login
- Cache embeddings and AI data to reduce costs
- Default to async background jobs for video/quiz heavy lifting
- Use Whop’s API/community to stay up to date on changes
- Iterate quickly: Whop audience responds to improved UX and new analytic tools
- Leverage your Discord/Telegram/influencer contacts for viral adoption

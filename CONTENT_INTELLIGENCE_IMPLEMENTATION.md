## üîë Key Features Implemented

### 1. Knowledge Gap Detection
**What it does**: Identifies topics students struggle with using AI analysis

**How it works**:
- Analyzes quiz failures to extract weak concepts
- Scans chat questions for confusion patterns
- Compares student progress to expected trajectory
- Uses Claude 3.5 Sonnet for concept extraction

**API**: `GET /api/intelligence/gaps`

**Example**:
```json
{
  "gaps": [
    {
      "concept": "React Hooks",
      "severity": "high",
      "evidence": {
        "questionsAsked": 12,
        "confusedStudents": 8
      },
      "recommendations": [
        "Review video: Understanding useState"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### 2. Adaptive Difficulty Engine
**What it does**: Adjusts content difficulty based on student performance

**Difficulty Levels**:
- `BEGINNER` - Slow pace, lots of examples
- `INTERMEDIATE` - Standard pace
- `ADVANCED` - Fast pace, challenging

**Triggers**:
- Quiz scores (avg < 50% ‚Üí decrease, avg > 85% ‚Üí increase)
- Completion rates (< 50% ‚Üí decrease, > 90% ‚Üí increase)
- Time spent patterns

**API**: `GET /api/intelligence/recommendations?count=5`

### 3. Engagement Analytics
**What it does**: Predicts student engagement and identifies at-risk students

**Score Calculation** (0-100):
- Recent Activity (25%): Days since last login
- Learning Streak (20%): Current streak vs target
- Video Completion (30%): Completion rate
- Quiz Performance (25%): Average quiz scores

**Risk Levels**:
- `none` (80-100): Excellent engagement
- `low` (60-79): Minor concerns
- `medium` (40-59): Needs attention
- `high` (20-39): At risk of dropout
- `critical` (0-19): Likely to drop out

**API**: `GET /api/intelligence/engagement`

### 4. Content Health Monitor
**What it does**: Analyzes video quality and effectiveness

**Metrics Tracked**:
- Completion rate (% who finish video)
- Average quiz score (performance after watching)
- Rewatch rate (how often students rewatch)
- Confusion signals (questions showing confusion)

**Overall Score**: Weighted average of all metrics (0-100)

**Issues Detected**:
- Low completion (< 50%)
- Poor quiz performance (< 60%)
- High confusion (> 10 signals)
- Outdated content

**API**: `GET /api/intelligence/health?videoId=xxx`

### 5. AI Insights Generator
**What it does**: Creates weekly AI-generated insights for creators

**Insight Types**:
- `content_quality` - Video needs improvement
- `student_risk` - Students at risk of dropping
- `gap_detection` - Missing content in curriculum
- `engagement_drop` - Overall engagement declining
- `performance_improvement` - Optimization opportunities

**Priority Levels**:
- `critical` - Immediate action required
- `high` - Important, address soon
- `medium` - Notable, plan to address
- `low` - Informational

**API**: `GET /api/intelligence/insights`

### 6. Content Recommendations
**What it does**: Suggests next videos and generates learning paths

**Recommendation Methods**:
- Collaborative filtering (students like you watched...)
- Content-based (similar topics and difficulty)
- Sequential (next in curriculum)
- Adaptive (matched to current level)

**Learning Paths**:
- Goal-based (e.g., "get React job")
- Personalized difficulty
- Estimated duration in weeks
- Milestones (quizzes, projects)

**API**: `POST /api/intelligence/recommendations/path`

## üìà Example Metrics

### Engagement Score Calculation
```
Student Activity:
- Days since active: 3 (target: 30) ‚Üí 27/30 = 90%
- Current streak: 7 (target: 7) ‚Üí 100%
- Video completion: 24/30 = 80%
- Quiz avg: 75% (target: 70%) ‚Üí 107%

Score = (90% √ó 0.25) + (100% √ó 0.2) + (80% √ó 0.3) + (100% √ó 0.25)
      = 22.5 + 20 + 24 + 25
      = 91.5 ‚âà 92/100

Risk Level: none (excellent engagement)
```

### Content Health Score
```
Video: "Understanding React Hooks"

Metrics:
- Completion rate: 65%
- Avg quiz score: 72%
- Rewatch rate: 15%
- Confusion signals: 5

Score = (65 √ó 0.3) + (72 √ó 0.35) + (85 √ó 0.2) + (90 √ó 0.15)
      = 19.5 + 25.2 + 17 + 13.5
      = 75/100

Assessment: Good quality, minor improvements needed

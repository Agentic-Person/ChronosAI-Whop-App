## 🐛 Resolved Issues

### Fixed in Latest Build
1. ✅ **creator_id propagation** - Now flows through entire pipeline
2. ✅ **API retry logic** - Exponential backoff prevents failures
3. ✅ **FREE tier enforcement** - 3 questions hard limit
4. ✅ **AWS dependencies** - Completely removed
5. ✅ **Processing status** - Enum conflicts resolved

### Remaining Non-Critical Issues
1. ⚠️ Audio extraction returns video path (workaround in place)
2. ⚠️ Large files >25MB need splitting (rare edge case)
3. ⚠️ Email notifications not configured (optional feature)
